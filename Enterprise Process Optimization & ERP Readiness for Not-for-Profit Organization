1. Improve and map end-to-end business value streams
2. Design a future-state operating model
3. Support ERP vendor selection and implementation readiness
4. Define KPIs and reporting needs
5. Clarify roles and responsibilities to enhance service delivery

## Key Deliverables
- Current-State & Future-State BPMN Diagrams
- Business Requirements Document (BRD)
- ERP Tender Document
- RACI Matrix
- KPI Definitions and Dashboard Wireframes
- Updated Role Descriptions

## Methodology
- **Approach**: Waterfall with iterative BA cycles
- **Tools**: BPMN, RACI Matrix, Stakeholder Mapping
- **Techniques**: SME interviews, workshops, and best-practice templates

## Business Analyst Tasks

### 1. Stakeholder Analysis
- Identified executives, leads, IT, and frontline staff
- Created a stakeholder influence/interest map

I want to access all customer data from one interface,  
So that I can resolve issues quickly without switching systems.
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Unified view of all customer data
- System response time â‰¤ 3 seconds
